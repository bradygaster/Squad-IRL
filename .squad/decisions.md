# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: SDK distribution stays on GitHub
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Distribution is `npx github:bradygaster/squad` — never move to npmjs.com.
**Why:** GitHub-native distribution aligns with the Copilot ecosystem. No registry dependency.

### 2026-02-21: v1 docs are internal only
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** No published docs site for v1. Documentation is team-facing only.
**Why:** Ship the runtime first. Public docs come later when the API surface stabilizes.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js ≥20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21T20:25:35Z: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend — Squad shells out to it for completions, not the other way around.
**Why:** Copilot CLI has usability issues (unreliable agent handoffs, no visibility into background work). Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.
**How:** Terminal UI with `ink` (React for CLIs), SDK session management with streaming, direct agent spawning (one session per agent). This becomes Wave 0 (foundation).
**Decisions needed:** Terminal UI library (ink vs. blessed), streaming (event-driven vs. polling), session lifecycle (per-agent vs. pool), background cleanup (explicit vs. timeout).

### 2026-02-21T21:22:47Z: User directive — rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** "squad watch" should be renamed to "squad triage" — user feedback that the command name should reflect active categorization/routing, not passive observation.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — CLI command naming: `squad loop`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The work monitor CLI command should be `squad loop`, not `squad ralph` or `squad monitor`. "Loop" is universally understood — no Squad lore needed. Finalized preference (supersedes Keaton's recommendations in favor of `squad monitor`). Update issue #269 accordingly.
**Why:** User request — final naming decision. Brady prefers `squad loop` for clarity and universal understanding.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — `squad hire` CLI command
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Add a `squad hire` CLI command. This is the team creation entry point — the init experience with personality. "squad hire" instead of "squad init".
**Why:** User request — Brady wants CLI commands that feel natural and match Squad's identity.

### 2026-02-21: CLI rename — `watch` → `triage` (recommended) (consolidated)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`. Keep `watch` as silent alias for backward compatibility. Explicitly recommend against `squad ralph` as a CLI command. Suggest `squad monitor` or `squad loop` instead to describe the persistent monitoring function.
**Why:** "Triage" is 40% more semantically accurate (matches GitHub's own terminology and incident-management patterns). "Ralph" is internal lore — opaque to new users and violates CLI UX conventions (all user-facing commands are action verbs or domain nouns). `squad monitor` is self-describing and professional.
**Details:** Change is low-risk. Silent alias prevents breakage. Confidence 85% for triage rename, 90% confidence Ralph shouldn't be user-facing.
**Reference:** Keaton analysis in `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-cli-rename.md`

### 2026-02-21: SDK M0 blocker — upgrade from `file:` to npm reference (resolved)
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert), Edie (implementation)
**What:** Change `optionalDependencies` from `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` to `"@github/copilot-sdk": "^0.1.25"`. The SDK is published on npm (28 versions, SLSA attestations). This one-line change unblocks npm publish and removes CI dependency on sibling directory.
**Why:** The `file:` reference is the only M0 blocker. Squad's SDK surface is minimal (1 runtime import: `CopilotClient`). Keep SDK in `optionalDependencies` to preserve zero-dependency scaffolding guarantee (Rabin decision).
**Verified:** Build passes (0 errors), all 1592 tests pass with npm reference. No tests require live Copilot CLI server. PR #271 merged successfully.
**Reference:** Kujan audit + Edie implementation in `.squad/decisions/inbox/edie-sdk-swap.md`
**Closes:** #190, #193, #194

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred — don't clutter it.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**PR:** #274
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references like `"0.6.0-alpha.0"`) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically by matching the package name in the `workspaces` glob — a version-string reference is all that's needed. Using npm-native semantics avoids toolchain lock-in and keeps the monorepo compatible with stock npm.
**Impact:** All future inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Resolution module placement and API separation
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #210, #211
**What:**
- `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` live in `src/resolution.ts` at the repo root, not in `packages/squad-sdk/`.
- The two functions are independent — `resolveSquad()` does NOT automatically fall back to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()`.
**Why:**
1. **Placement:** Code hasn't migrated to the monorepo packages yet. Putting it in `packages/squad-sdk/src/` would create a split that doesn't match the current build pipeline (`tsc` compiles `src/` to `dist/`). When the monorepo migration happens, `src/resolution.ts` moves with everything else.
2. **Separation of concerns:** Issue #210 says "repo squad always wins over personal squad" — that's a *policy* decision for the consumer, not for the resolution primitives. Keeping the two functions independent lets CLI/runtime compose them however needed (e.g., try repo first, fall back to global, or merge both).
**Impact:** Low. When packages split happens, move `src/resolution.ts` into `packages/squad-sdk/src/`. The public API shape stays the same.

### 2026-02-21: Changesets setup — independent versioning for squad-sdk and squad-cli
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #208
**What:** Installed and configured @changesets/cli v2 for independent package versioning across the monorepo.
**Configuration:**
- `access`: `"public"` (both packages will be published)
- `baseBranch`: `"main"` (release branch for changesets)
- `fixed`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `linked`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `updateInternalDependencies`: `"patch"` (default, appropriate for SDK→CLI dependency)
**Why:** Squad is a monorepo with two distinct packages (squad-sdk and squad-cli) with different release cadences and audiences. Independent versioning prevents unnecessary releases and version inflation when only one package changes.
**Implementation:** `.changeset/config.json` created, npm script `changeset:check` added to `package.json` for CI validation.
**Next Steps:** Contributors use `npx changeset add` before merge; release workflow runs `changeset publish` to GitHub.

### 2026-02-21: --global flag and status command pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #212, #213
**What:**
- `--global` flag on `init` and `upgrade` routes to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` instead of `process.cwd()`.
- `squad status` composes both `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` to show which squad is active and why.
- All routing logic stays in `src/index.ts` main() — init.ts and upgrade.ts are path-agnostic (they take a `dest` string).
**Why:**
1. **Thin CLI contract:** init and upgrade already accept a destination directory. The `--global` flag is a CLI concern, not a runtime concern — so it lives in the CLI routing layer only.
2. **Composition over fallback:** `squad status` demonstrates the intended consumer pattern from #210/#211: try repo resolution first, then check global path. The resolution primitives stay independent.
3. **Debugging UX:** Status shows repo resolution, global path, and global squad existence — all the info needed to debug "why isn't my squad loading?" issues.
**Impact:** Low. Single-file change to `src/index.ts`. No changes to resolution algorithms or init/upgrade internals.

### 2026-02-21: No repo root clutter — ensureSquadPath() guard
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #273

**What:**
- Added `ensureSquadPath(filePath, squadRoot)` in `src/resolution.ts` — a guard that validates a target path is inside `.squad/` or the system temp directory before any write occurs. Throws with a descriptive error if the path is outside both.
- Exported from the public API (`src/index.ts`).

**Why:**
Brady's hard rule: ALL squad scratch/temp/state files MUST go in `.squad/` only. During issue creation, 20+ temp files were written directly to the repo root. This guard provides a single validation function that any file-writing code path can call to enforce the policy deterministically (per the hooks-over-prompts decision).

**Audit findings:**
- 30+ file write calls across `src/` — most already write into `.squad/` subdirectories or user-requested destinations.
- The `tools/index.ts` write_file tool and `cli/commands/export.ts` write to user-specified paths (intentional, user-requested).
- No existing code paths were changed — this is a new guard utility for future enforcement.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only change. Existing behavior unchanged. Future code that writes temp/scratch files should call `ensureSquadPath()` before writing.

### 2026-02-21: CLI routing logic is testable via composition, not process spawning
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #214

**What:** Integration tests for `squad status` and `--global` flag test the *routing logic* (the conditional expressions from `main()`) directly, rather than spawning a child process and parsing stdout.

**Why:**
1. `main()` in `src/index.ts` calls `process.exit()` and is not exported — spawning would be flaky and slow.
2. The routing logic is simple conditionals over `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` — testing those compositions directly is deterministic and fast.
3. If `main()` is ever refactored to export a testable function, these tests can be upgraded — the assertions stay the same.

**Impact:** Low. Sets a pattern for future CLI integration tests: test the logic, not the process.

### 2026-02-21: Ink + React dependency versions
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #233
**PR:** #281

**What:**
- **ink@6.8.0** — latest stable, ESM-native, no CJS shims required
- **react@19.2.4** — required by ink 6.x (peer dependency); React 19 is ESM-friendly
- **ink-testing-library@4.0.0** — matches ink 6.x major version pairing
- **@types/react@19.2.14** — TypeScript types for React 19

**Why:** ink 6.x + React 19 are fully ESM-native — aligns with our ESM-only policy. ink-testing-library enables unit-testing ink components without a real terminal. All added as root-level deps for now; can be scoped to `packages/squad-cli` during monorepo migration.

**Impact:** Low. No source changes — dependency additions only. Build passes (tsc strict), all 1621 tests pass.

### 2026-02-21: GitHub-native distribution deprecated in favor of npm
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #219

**What:**
- Root `cli.js` now prints a deprecation warning to stderr when invoked via `npx github:bradygaster/squad`.
- Users are directed to `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`.
- The warning is non-blocking — existing behavior continues after the notice.

**Why:** The `@bradygaster/squad-cli` and `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` packages are now published to npm. The GitHub-native distribution (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`) was the original entry point but is now superseded. This deprecation notice gives users a migration path before the GitHub-native entry point is eventually removed.

**Supersedes:** The earlier "SDK distribution stays on GitHub" decision (Keaton, carried from beta). npm is now the primary distribution channel.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only change to the bundled `cli.js`. No behavior change — just a stderr warning.

### 2026-02-21: Shell chrome patterns and session registry design
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #236, #237

**Shell Chrome:** The interactive shell header uses box-drawing characters (`╭╰│─`) for visual chrome. Version is read from `package.json` at runtime via `createRequire(import.meta.url)` — no hardcoded version strings. Box-drawing chrome is universally supported in modern terminals and provides clear visual framing without external dependencies. Using `createRequire` for JSON import follows the existing pattern in `src/build/github-dist.ts` and avoids ESM JSON import assertions.

**Exit handling:** Three exit paths — `exit` command, `/quit` command, and Ctrl+C (SIGINT). All produce the same cleanup message ("👋 Squad out.") for consistency.

**Session Registry:** `SessionRegistry` is a simple Map-backed class with no persistence, no event emitting, and no external dependencies. It tracks agent sessions by name with status lifecycle: `idle` → `working` → `streaming` → `idle`/`error`. Designed as a pure state container that the ink UI will consume. The Map-based approach allows O(1) lookup by agent name, which is the primary access pattern for status display.

**Impact:** Low. Two files changed. No API surface changes outside the shell module. SessionRegistry is exported for future consumption but has no current consumers.

### 2026-02-21: TSX compilation enabled in root tsconfig
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #242, #243, #244

**What:** Added `"jsx": "react-jsx"` to the root `tsconfig.json` to enable TSX compilation for ink-based React components in `src/cli/shell/components/`.

**Why:** The shell UI uses ink (React for CLIs), which requires JSX support. `react-jsx` is the modern transform — no need to import React in every file for JSX (though we do for explicitness). This is a project-wide setting because all TSX files live under `src/` which is the root `rootDir`.

**Components created:**
- `AgentPanel.tsx` — agent status display (consumes `AgentSession` from `types.ts`)
- `MessageStream.tsx` — streaming message output (consumes `ShellMessage` from `types.ts`)
- `InputPrompt.tsx` — readline input with history navigation
- `components/index.ts` — barrel export

All components are pure presentational — no SDK calls, no side effects. State management is the responsibility of the shell orchestrator.

**Impact:** Low. Only affects `.tsx` files. No existing `.ts` files are impacted. The setting is compatible with strict mode and NodeNext module resolution.

### 2026-02-21: Shell module structure and entry point routing
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #234, #235
**PR:** #282

**What:**
- `src/cli/shell/` module created with `index.ts`, `types.ts`, and `components/` placeholder directory.
- `squad` with no args now launches `runShell()` (interactive shell) instead of `runInit()`.
- `squad init` remains available as an explicit subcommand — no functionality removed.

**Why:**
1. **Entry point change:** Brady's directive makes the interactive shell the primary UX. Running `squad` with no args should enter the shell, not re-run init. Init is still available via `squad init`.
2. **Placeholder over premature implementation:** `runShell()` is console.log-only. Ink dependency is handled separately (#233). This keeps the shell module structure ready without coupling to the UI library.
3. **Types first:** `ShellState`, `ShellMessage`, and `AgentSession` interfaces define the shell's data model before any UI code exists. This lets other agents (ink wiring, agent spawning) code against stable types.

**Impact:** Low. No existing tests broken (1621/1621 pass). The only behavior change is `squad` (no args) prints a shell header and exits instead of running init. `squad init` and `squad --help` / `squad help` continue to work as before.

### 2026-02-21: Agent spawn infrastructure pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #238

**What:** Created `src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` with three exported functions:
- `loadAgentCharter(name, teamRoot?)` — filesystem charter loading via `resolveSquad()`
- `buildAgentPrompt(charter, options?)` — system prompt construction from charter + context
- `spawnAgent(name, task, registry, options?)` — full spawn lifecycle with SessionRegistry integration

SDK session creation (CopilotClient) is intentionally stubbed. The spawn infrastructure is complete; session wiring comes when we understand the SDK's session management API.

**Why:**
1. **Separation of concerns:** Charter loading, prompt building, and session lifecycle are independent functions. This lets stream bridge and coordinator reuse `buildAgentPrompt` and `spawnAgent` without coupling.
2. **Testability:** `teamRoot` parameter on `loadAgentCharter` allows tests to point at a fixture directory without mocking `resolveSquad()`.
3. **Stub-first:** Rather than guessing the CopilotClient session API shape, we built the surrounding infrastructure. The TODO is a single integration point — when the SDK surface is clear, the change is surgical.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only. No existing behavior changed. Two files modified: `spawn.ts` (new), `index.ts` (barrel exports added).

### 2026-02-21: Session lifecycle owns team discovery
**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #240

**What:** `ShellLifecycle.initialize()` is the single entry point for team discovery in the interactive shell. It reads `.squad/team.md`, parses the Members table, and registers active agents in `SessionRegistry`. No other shell component should independently parse `team.md` or discover agents.

**Why:**
1. **Single responsibility:** Team discovery is a lifecycle concern — it happens once at shell startup. Scattering `team.md` parsing across components would create divergent interpretations of the manifest format.
2. **Testability:** By owning initialization, `ShellLifecycle` can be tested with a mock filesystem (or temp `.squad/` directory) without touching the registry or renderer.
3. **State consistency:** The lifecycle class is the source of truth for shell state. If initialization fails (missing `.squad/`, missing `team.md`), the state transitions to `error` and downstream components can check `getState().status` rather than catching exceptions everywhere.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only. Future shell features (command routing, agent spawning) should call `lifecycle.getDiscoveredAgents()` instead of re-parsing `team.md`.

### 2026-02-21: StreamBridge is an event sink, not a subscriber
**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #239

**What:** `StreamBridge` receives `StreamingEvent` objects via `handleEvent()` but does not register itself with `StreamingPipeline`. The wiring (`pipeline.onDelta(e => bridge.handleEvent(e))`) is the caller's responsibility.

**Why:**
1. **Testability:** The bridge can be tested with plain event objects — no pipeline instance needed.
2. **Flexibility:** The shell entry point controls which events reach the bridge (e.g., filtering by session, throttling for UI frame rate).
3. **Single responsibility:** The bridge translates events to callbacks; it doesn't manage subscriptions or lifecycle.

**Impact:** Low. Pattern applies to all future bridges between the pipeline and UI layers (ink components, web sockets, etc.).

### 2026-02-21: Shell module test patterns — fixtures over mocks
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #248

**What:** Shell module tests use `test-fixtures/.squad/` with real files (team.md, routing.md, agent charters) instead of mocking fs calls. The `loadAgentCharter` and `buildCoordinatorPrompt` functions accept a `teamRoot` parameter that enables this pattern.

**Why:**
1. Real file reads catch encoding issues, path resolution bugs, and parsing edge cases that mocks hide.
2. The `teamRoot` parameter was already designed into the API — tests should use it.
3. StreamBridge tests use callback spies (arrays capturing calls) rather than vi.fn() — simpler to assert on and read.

**Impact:** Low. Establishes fixture patterns for future shell module tests. test-fixtures/.squad/ is now a shared test resource.

### 2026-02-21: Branch protection configuration
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #209

**Main Branch Protection:** Require PR + passing build status checks. All changes to main require a PR (not direct push). PR cannot be merged until `build` check passes (CI/CD gate). Zero approving reviews required — allows team to use PR merge buttons freely (no blocking review workflow needed). Admins not exempted (same rules apply to everyone, strengthens process integrity).

**Insider Branch:** No protection — allows direct pushes. Insider releases are automation-driven; direct branch push is the automation's path.

**Implementation:** Used GitHub API (REST v3): `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection` with required_status_checks + required_pull_request_reviews. `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/insider/protection` confirmed no-op (no existing rule).

**Note:** Status check context name is `"build"` — must match the exact check name from CI workflow. If CI workflow renames the check, branch protection must be updated to match.

### 2026-02-21: Insider publish package scaffolds
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #215
**PR:** #283

**What:** Added minimal publishable entry points to `packages/squad-sdk/` and `packages/squad-cli/` so the insider publish workflow can produce valid npm packages.

**squad-sdk:**
- `src/index.ts`: exports `VERSION` constant (placeholder — full source migration comes later)
- `tsconfig.json`: extends root, outputs to `dist/` with declarations
- `package.json`: added `files`, `scripts.build`

**squad-cli:**
- `src/cli.ts`: placeholder binary (`#!/usr/bin/env node`)
- `tsconfig.json`: extends root, outputs to `dist/` with declarations
- `package.json`: added `files`, `scripts.build`; `bin` already pointed to `./dist/cli.js`

**Root:** `build` script updated: `tsc && npm run build --workspaces --if-present`

**Why:** The insider publish pipeline triggers on push to `insider` branch but both workspace packages were empty scaffolds — no source, no build output, nothing to publish. This adds the minimum viable content so `npm publish` succeeds and the insider channel can be verified end-to-end.

**Constraints respected:** ESM-only, TypeScript strict mode, Node.js >=20, squad-cli depends on squad-sdk via version string, `files` lists ensure only `dist/` and `README.md` ship in the published package.

**Impact:** Low. Does not migrate real source code — these are placeholders. Does not add tests for workspace packages (nothing to test yet).

### 2026-02-21: Distribution moves to npm for production
**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #216

**What:** Squad packages (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli`) are now distributed via npmjs.com. This supersedes the beta-era decision "Distribution is `npx github:bradygaster/squad` — never move to npmjs.com."

**Why:** The project has matured from beta to production. npm is the standard distribution channel for Node.js packages. The insider publish (`0.6.0-alpha.0`) validated the pipeline. Production publish (`0.6.0`) is the natural next step.

**Workflow:** Tag push `v*` on `main` triggers `.github/workflows/squad-publish.yml`. Auth is CI-only via `setup-node` + `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. No root `.npmrc` needed. No `--provenance` (private repo limitation).

**Impact:** Users install via `npm install @bradygaster/squad-cli` (or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`). The GitHub-native `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path may still work but is no longer the primary distribution channel.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinator prompt structure — three routing modes
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #241

**What:** The coordinator system prompt (`buildCoordinatorPrompt()`) uses a structured response format with three routing modes:
- `DIRECT:` — coordinator answers inline, no agent spawn
- `ROUTE:` + `TASK:` + `CONTEXT:` — single agent delegation
- `MULTI:` with bullet list — fan-out to multiple agents

The parser (`parseCoordinatorResponse()`) extracts a `RoutingDecision` from the LLM response. Unrecognized formats fall back to `DIRECT` (safe default — never silently drops input).

**Why:**
1. **Structured output over free-form:** Keyword prefixes (`ROUTE:`, `DIRECT:`, `MULTI:`) are cheap to parse and reliable across model temperatures. No JSON parsing needed.
2. **Fallback-to-direct:** If the LLM doesn't follow the format, the response is surfaced to the user rather than lost. This prevents silent failures in the routing layer.
3. **Prompt composition from files:** team.md and routing.md are read at prompt-build time, not baked in. This means the coordinator adapts to team changes without code changes.

**Impact:** Low. Additive module. No changes to existing shell behavior. Future work will wire this into the readline loop and SDK session.
### 2026-02-21: CRLF normalization — single utility, applied at parser entry points
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Re:** #220, #221 (Epic #181)

**What:**
- Created `src/utils/normalize-eol.ts` exporting `normalizeEol(content: string): string` — replaces `\r\n` and `\r` with `\n`.
- Applied as the first line of 8 parser functions across 6 files: markdown-migration.ts (3 parsers), routing.ts, charter-compiler.ts, skill-loader.ts, agent-doc.ts, doc-sync.ts.

**Why:**
On Windows with `core.autocrlf=true`, file reads return `\r\n` line endings. Every parser that calls `.split('\n')` would leave stray `\r` characters in parsed values — breaking regex matches, table parsing, and string comparisons. Normalizing at the parser entry point is the minimal defensive guard: one line per function, no behavioral change on LF-only systems.

**Pattern:**
Always normalize at the *entry* of the parsing function, not at the file-read callsite. This ensures parsers are self-contained and safe regardless of how content arrives (file read, API response, test fixture).

**Impact:**
Low. Additive-only. No test changes needed. Existing tests pass because test strings are already LF-only. The guard is transparent for LF inputs.

### 2026-02-21: CLI entry point split — src/index.ts is a pure barrel
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Re:** #187

**What:**
- `src/index.ts` is now a pure re-export barrel with ZERO side effects. No `main()`, no `process.exit()`, no argument parsing.
- `src/cli-entry.ts` contains the full `main()` function and all CLI routing logic.
- `VERSION` is exported from `index.ts` (public API constant); `cli-entry.ts` imports it.
- `SquadError` is now explicitly exported from the barrel.

**Why:**
Anyone importing `@bradygaster/squad` as a library (e.g., SquadUI) was triggering CLI argument parsing and `process.exit()` on import. This poisoned the library entry point. The split makes `dist/index.js` safe for library consumption while `dist/cli-entry.js` remains the CLI binary.

**Impact:**
Low. Two files changed. Build passes (tsc strict), all 1683 tests pass. No changes to package.json `bin` or `main`.

**Future:**
When source migrates to `packages/squad-cli/`, the CLI entry point moves with it. The barrel (`packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts`) stays side-effect-free.

### 2026-02-21: Process.exit() refactor — library-safe CLI functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**Re:** #189

**What:**
- `fatal()` now throws `SquadError` instead of calling `process.exit(1)`.
- `src/index.ts` is a pure barrel export with zero side effects (no `main()`, no `process.exit()`).
- `src/cli-entry.ts` is the sole CLI entry point — it catches `SquadError` and calls `process.exit(1)`.
- `runWatch()` resolves its Promise on SIGINT/SIGTERM instead of `process.exit(0)`.
- `runShell()` closes readline on SIGINT instead of `process.exit(0)`.
- `SquadError` class is exported from the public API.

**Why:**
SquadUI (VS Code extension) imports CLI functions as a library. `process.exit()` kills the entire VS Code extension host. All library-consumable functions must throw errors or return results, never call `process.exit()`. Only the CLI entry point (the thin presentation layer) may call `process.exit()`.

**Pattern established:**
- Library functions: throw `SquadError` or return result objects
- CLI entry point: catches errors, formats output, calls `process.exit()`
- Library consumers: catch `SquadError` for structured error handling

**Impact:**
Medium. Changes error handling contract for all functions that used `fatal()`. Backwards-compatible for CLI users (same behavior). Library consumers now get catchable errors instead of process termination.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — docs as you go
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** Doc and blog as you go during SquadUI integration work. Doesn't have to be perfect — a proper docs pass comes later — but keep docs updated incrementally.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-22T035939Z: Repository scope directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Do NOT change anything in bradygaster/squad repo. This working copy is bradygaster/squad-pr — changes are permitted here. The two repos are distinct.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-22: SDK/CLI File Split Plan — Definitive Mapping
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Status:** Decision
**Scope:** Monorepo restructure — move `src/` into `packages/squad-sdk/` and `packages/squad-cli/`

**Overview:** All 114 `.ts` files in root `src/` must be split between two workspace packages. The dependency direction is **one-way: CLI → SDK**. No SDK module imports from CLI. This is clean and the split is mechanical.

**SDK Package (`packages/squad-sdk/src/`):**
- **Directories:** adapter, agents, build, casting, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools, utils (15 total)
- **Standalone files:** index.ts, resolution.ts, parsers.ts, types.ts
- **Exports:** Expanded to 18 subpath exports matching directory structure
- **Dependencies:** `@github/copilot-sdk` only (zero UI deps)

**CLI Package (`packages/squad-cli/src/`):**
- **Directories:** cli/ (all CLI submodules: core/, commands/, shell/, components/)
- **Standalone files:** cli-entry.ts (becomes `bin.squad` target)
- **Dependencies:** `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`, ink, react, esbuild

**Root Package:**
- **Role:** Workspace orchestrator only (not publishable)
- **Preserved:** `package.json` (workspace def), tsconfig.json (base config), vitest.config.ts, test/, test-fixtures/, templates/, docs/, .squad/
- **Removed:** main, types, bin, runtime dependencies

**Key Call — SDK Barrel Cleanup:** Remove CLI utilities (`success`, `error`, `warn`, `fatal`, etc.) from SDK exports. CLI re-exports in `src/index.ts` were a mistake — those are CLI implementation details, not SDK API. This is a breaking change that's correct and intentional.

**Import Rewriting Rules:**
- CLI → SDK relative imports become package imports (`from '../config/'` → `from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config'`)
- Intra-SDK and intra-CLI imports stay relative (unchanged)

### 2026-02-22: CharterCompiler reuses parseCharterMarkdown — no duplicate parsing

**By:** Edie

**What:** `CharterCompiler.compile()` delegates to the existing `parseCharterMarkdown()` function from `charter-compiler.ts` rather than implementing its own markdown parser. The legacy class is a thin filesystem wrapper around the already-tested parsing logic.

**Why:** Single source of truth for charter parsing. The `parseCharterMarkdown` function already handles all `## Identity` and `## Model` field extraction with tested regex patterns. Duplicating that logic would create drift risk.

### 2026-02-22: AgentSessionManager uses optional EventBus injection

**By:** Edie

**What:** `AgentSessionManager` constructor accepts an optional `EventBus` parameter. When present, `spawn()` emits `session.created` and `destroy()` emits `session.destroyed`. When absent, the manager works silently (no events).

**Why:** Keeps the manager testable without requiring a full event bus setup. Coordinator can wire the bus when available; unit tests can omit it.

### 2026-02-22: Ink Shell Wiring — ShellApi callback pattern

**By:** Fenster

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Status:** Implemented

**Context:** The shell needed to move from a readline echo loop to an Ink-based UI using the three existing components (AgentPanel, MessageStream, InputPrompt). The key challenge was connecting the StreamBridge (which pushes events from the streaming pipeline) into React component state.

**Decision:** **ShellApi callback pattern:** The `App` component accepts an `onReady` prop that fires once on mount, delivering a `ShellApi` object with three methods: `addMessage`, `setStreamingContent`, `refreshAgents`. The host (`runShell()`) captures this API and wires it to StreamBridge callbacks.

This keeps the Ink component decoupled from StreamBridge internals — the component doesn't import or know about the bridge. The host is the only place where both meet.

**`React.createElement` in index.ts:** Rather than renaming `index.ts` to `index.tsx` (which would ripple through exports maps and imports), `runShell()` uses `React.createElement(App, props)` directly. This keeps the file extension stable.

**Streaming content accumulation:** StreamBridge's `onContent` callback delivers deltas. The host maintains a `streamBuffers` Map to accumulate content per agent and pushes the full accumulated string to `setStreamingContent`. On `onComplete`, the buffer is cleared and the final message is added.

**Consequences:** StreamBridge is ready for coordinator wiring — call `_bridge.handleEvent(event)` when the coordinator emits streaming events. Direct agent messages and coordinator routing show placeholders until coordinator integration (Phase 3). All existing exports from `shell/index.ts` are preserved. New exports: `App`, `ShellApi`, `AppProps`.

### 2026-02-22: Runtime EventBus as canonical bus for orchestration classes

**By:** Fortier

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Scope:** Coordinator, Ralph, and future orchestration components

**Decision:** The `runtime/event-bus.ts` (colon-notation: `session:created`, `subscribe()` API, built-in error isolation via `executeHandler()`) is the canonical EventBus for all orchestration classes. The `client/event-bus.ts` (dot-notation: `session.created`, `on()` API) remains for backward-compat but should not be used in new code.

**Rationale:**
- Runtime EventBus has proper error isolation — one handler failure doesn't crash others
- SquadCoordinator (M3-1) tests already use RuntimeEventBus
- Consistent API surface (`subscribe`/`subscribeAll`/`unsubscribe`) is cleaner than `on`/`onAny`
- Event type strings use colon-notation which avoids ambiguity with property access patterns

**Impact:**
- Coordinator and RalphMonitor now import from `../runtime/event-bus.js`
- All new EventBus consumers should follow this pattern
- Client EventBus remains exported for external consumers

### 2026-02-22: Runtime Module Test Patterns

**By:** Hockney (Tester)

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Status:** Adopted

**Context:** Writing proactive tests for runtime modules (CharterCompiler, AgentSessionManager, Coordinator, RalphMonitor) being built in parallel by multiple team members.

**Decisions:**

1. **Two EventBus APIs require different mocks.** The client EventBus uses `on()`/`emit()` while the runtime EventBus uses `subscribe()`/`emit()`. Tests must use the correct mock depending on which bus the module under test consumes. AgentSessionManager uses the client bus (`on`); Coordinator uses the runtime bus (`subscribe`).

2. **CharterCompiler tests use real test-fixtures.** Instead of mocking the filesystem, we read from `test-fixtures/.squad/agents/` for `compile()` and `compileAll()` tests. This gives integration-level confidence. Only `parseCharterMarkdown` uses inline string fixtures for unit isolation.

3. **Coordinator routing priority is: direct > @mention > team keyword > default.** Tests explicitly verify this ordering. Any change to routing logic must preserve this priority chain.

4. **RalphMonitor tests are future-proof stubs.** Since Ralph is mostly TODO stubs, tests validate current behavior (empty arrays, no-throw lifecycle) and will automatically exercise real logic once implemented — no test changes needed.

**Impact:**
- 105 new tests across 4 files, all passing
- Test count: 1727 → 1832 across 61 files
- No circular dependencies verified (clean DAG)

**Migration Order:**
1. **Phase 1 (SDK first):** Copy 15 dirs + 4 files, update exports, build in isolation
2. **Phase 2 (CLI second):** Copy cli/ + cli-entry.ts, rewrite imports to SDK packages, build against SDK
3. **Phase 3 (root cleanup):** Delete root src/, update test imports, finalize structure

**Templates:** Copy into CLI package (Option A — self-contained packages).

**Why:** One-way dependency graphs enable independent package evolution. SDK stays pure library; CLI stays thin consumer. Future features only touch the relevant package.

### 2026-02-22: Version Alignment — 0.7.0 stubs → 0.8.0 real packages
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Status:** APPROVED & EXECUTED

**Context:**
- **0.7.0 npm stubs:** Placeholder packages published on npmjs.com (no real code)
- **Goal:** Publish real, working code under new version

**Decision: Bump to 0.8.0**
- **Rationale:** Clear break from stubs (0.7.0 is placeholder; 0.8.0 is functional code). Pre-1.0 signal appropriate for alpha software.

**Changes Executed:**
1. SDK `package.json`: version `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`
2. CLI `package.json`: version `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`, SDK dependency locked to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk@0.8.0`
3. SDK `src/index.ts`: `VERSION` export `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`
4. Root `package.json`: added `"private": true` (prevent accidental npm publish of workspace coordinator)

**Verification:** ✅ All version strings aligned, CLI dependency on SDK pinned, root marked private.

### 2026-02-22: Defer test import migration until root src/ removal
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** After SDK/CLI workspace split, all 56 test files still import from root `../src/`. Build and all 1719 tests pass cleanly because root `src/` still exists.

**Decision:** Defer migrating test imports from `../src/` to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` / `@bradygaster/squad-cli` until root `src/` is actually removed.

**Rationale:**
1. **Exports map gap:** SDK exposes 18 subpath exports; tests import ~40+ distinct deep internal paths not in exports map
2. **CLI no exports:** cli/shell/ tests have no package-level export path to migrate to
3. **Barrel divergence:** Root `src/index.ts` still exports CLI functions SDK package correctly does not
4. **Risk/reward:** 150+ import lines for zero functional benefit while root `src/` exists is pure risk

**When to revisit:** When root `src/` is deleted (blocker at that point). Options: expand exports maps, add vitest resolve.alias, or move tests into workspace packages.

### 2026-02-22: Build System Migration — tsconfig + package.json
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Status:** Decision
**Scope:** Monorepo build configuration for SDK/CLI workspace packages

**What Changed:**
1. **Root tsconfig.json:** Base config only, shared compiler options, `files: []` (compiles nothing), project references to both packages
2. **SDK tsconfig.json:** Extends root, `composite: true`, declarations + maps, no JSX
3. **CLI tsconfig.json:** Extends root, `composite: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`, references SDK package
4. **Root package.json:** `private: true`, workspace orchestrator, stripped main/types/bin/runtime deps
5. **SDK package.json:** 18 subpath exports, `@github/copilot-sdk` as direct dependency
6. **CLI package.json:** `bin.squad` → `./dist/cli-entry.js`, ink/react runtime deps, templates in files array

**Why `composite: true`:** TypeScript project references require this. Without it, cross-package type information fails to resolve.

**Build Order:** `npm run build --workspaces` builds SDK first (no deps), then CLI (depends on SDK). npm respects topological order automatically.

**Verified:** Both packages compile with zero errors. All dist artifacts (`.js`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`) emitted correctly.

### 2026-02-22: Subpath exports in @bradygaster/squad-sdk
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Issue:** #227

**What:** `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` declares 18 subpath exports (`.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, and 15 module paths). Each uses types-first condition ordering.

**Why:** Enables tree-shaking and focused imports. Consumers can `import { … } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config'` instead of pulling the entire barrel. Type-only consumers can import from `./types` with zero runtime cost.

**Constraints:**
- Every subpath must have a corresponding source barrel (`src/<path>.ts` or `src/<path>/index.ts`)
- `"types"` condition must appear before `"import"` — Node.js evaluates top-to-bottom
- ESM-only: no `"require"` condition per team decision
- Adding a new subpath requires both source barrel and exports entry; removing one without the other breaks resolution

### 2026-02-22: Barrel file conventions for parsers and types
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**Issues:** #225, #226 (Epic #181)

**What:**
- `src/parsers.ts` re-exports all parser functions AND their types using `export { ... } from` and `export type { ... } from`
- `src/types.ts` re-exports ONLY types using `export type { ... } from` exclusively — guaranteed zero runtime imports
- Both follow the existing ESM barrel pattern from `src/index.ts`

**Why:**
1. **Consumer convenience:** SquadUI and others can import parsers or types from a single module instead of reaching into internal paths
2. **Separation of concerns:** `types.ts` is safe for type-only contexts (declaration files). `parsers.ts` includes runtime functions for consumers that need them
3. **No existing modifications:** Both are additive-only new files — zero risk to existing behavior

**Impact:** Low. Two new files, no changes to existing source. Build passes, all 1683 tests pass.

### 2026-02-22: Use npm-native workspace resolution (not pnpm `workspace:*`)
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Applied

**Context:** Brady's task requested using `workspace:*` for the CLI→SDK dependency. However, this project uses npm workspaces (not pnpm or Yarn). The `workspace:` protocol is a pnpm/Yarn feature and npm rejects it with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`.

**Decision:** Use `"*"` as the version specifier instead. Under npm workspaces, when a dependency name matches a local workspace package, npm automatically resolves to the local package regardless of the version specifier. `"*"` accepts any version, ensuring the local SDK is always used during development.

**Trade-off:** `"*"` will be published as-is to npm (unlike pnpm's `workspace:*` which gets replaced with the real version at publish time). Before publishing the CLI package, the SDK dependency version should be pinned to the actual release version. A `prepublishOnly` script or CI step could automate this.

### 2026-02-22: Test import migration to workspace packages
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Implemented

**Context:** All 56 test files imported from root `src/` via relative paths (`../src/...`). With the SDK/CLI workspace split, tests needed to import from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` packages instead.

**Decision:**
1. **Barrel-first imports:** Where a barrel/index file re-exports symbols from sub-modules, tests import from the barrel path (e.g., `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config` instead of individual files).
2. **New subpath exports for orphaned modules:** 8 runtime/adapter modules not covered by existing barrels got new subpath exports in the SDK package.json.
3. **Missing barrel re-exports fixed:** `selectResponseTier`/`getTier` added to coordinator barrel; `onboardAgent`/`addAgentToConfig` added to agents barrel.
4. **CLI functions correctly located:** Consumer imports test updated to import CLI functions from `@bradygaster/squad-cli` (not SDK), reflecting intentional separation.

**Consequence:** Zero `grep -r "from '../src/" test/` results. All 1727 tests pass. SDK has 26 subpath exports, CLI has 17.

### 2026-02-22: CI/CD & Release Readiness Assessment
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

**Summary:** All 13 CI/CD workflows are production-ready and correctly configured. Merge drivers are in place. Branch protection is working. Publishing infrastructure works both for stable releases (v* tags) and pre-releases (insider branch).

**Version Status:**
- SDK `package.json`: 0.8.0
- CLI `package.json`: 0.8.1 (intentional patch for bin entry fix)
- CHANGELOG: 0.6.0-alpha.0 (root workspace marker)

**Workflow Audit:**
- ✅ Core CI validates on PR/push to main, dev, insider
- ✅ squad-publish.yml: Publishes both packages on v* tags with public access
- ✅ squad-insider-publish.yml: Auto-publishes on insider push with `--tag insider`
- ✅ Release/promote workflows fully functional

**Merge Drivers:** Union merge configured for append-only files (decisions.md, agents/*/history.md, log/**, orchestration-log/**).

**Release Readiness:** Insider channel ready now. Stable release ready after version alignment if desired.

**Recommendation:** Version alignment (SDK 0.8.0, CLI 0.8.0) simplifies CHANGELOG during pre-1.0. Separate versioning can be deferred post-1.0 if needed.

### 2026-02-22: Fix npx bin resolution for squad-cli
**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Implemented & Published

**Context:** `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.0` printed placeholder text instead of running the real CLI. The bin entry was `"squad": "./dist/cli-entry.js"` but npx resolves by unscoped package name (`squad-cli`), not by custom bin names.

**Decision:**
1. Added `"squad-cli"` as second bin entry pointing to `./dist/cli-entry.js`
2. Replaced orphaned placeholder `dist/cli.js` with redirect to `cli-entry.js`
3. Bumped version to 0.8.1 (0.8.0 immutable on npm)
4. Published @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.1 to npm

**Consequence:**
- `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` now runs the real CLI
- `squad` command still works for global installs
- Both bin names resolve to the same entry point
- Future releases must keep both bin entries




### OpenTelemetry version alignment: pin core packages to 1.30.x line
**By:** Edie
**Issue:** #254
**What:** All OTel optional dependencies in `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` must stay version-aligned: `sdk-node@^0.57.x` requires `sdk-trace-base@^1.30.0`, `sdk-trace-node@^1.30.0`, `sdk-metrics@^1.30.0`, `resources@^1.30.0`. These must be explicit optional dependencies, not left to transitive resolution.
**Why:** Without explicit pins, npm hoists the latest versions (2.x) of `sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-metrics`, and `resources` to the top-level `node_modules`. The 2.x types are structurally incompatible with the 1.x types that `sdk-node@0.57.x` transitively depends on, causing TS2345/TS2741 type errors (e.g., missing `instrumentationScope` on `ReadableSpan`, missing `getRawAttributes` on `Resource`). Explicit pins at `^1.30.0` force npm to deduplicate on the 1.x line, eliminating the type conflicts.


# Decision: OpenTelemetry Tracing for Agent Lifecycle & Coordinator Routing

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**By:** Fenster  
**Issues:** #257, #258  
**Status:** Implemented

## What

Added OpenTelemetry trace instrumentation to four files in `packages/squad-sdk/src/`:

1. **`agents/index.ts`** — AgentSessionManager: `spawn()`, `resume()`, `destroy()` wrapped with spans (`squad.agent.spawn`, `squad.agent.resume`, `squad.agent.destroy`).
2. **`agents/lifecycle.ts`** — AgentLifecycleManager: `spawnAgent()`, `destroyAgent()` wrapped with spans (`squad.lifecycle.spawnAgent`, `squad.lifecycle.destroyAgent`).
3. **`coordinator/index.ts`** — Coordinator: `initialize()`, `route()`, `execute()`, `shutdown()` wrapped with spans (`squad.coordinator.initialize`, `squad.coordinator.route`, `squad.coordinator.execute`, `squad.coordinator.shutdown`).
4. **`coordinator/coordinator.ts`** — SquadCoordinator: `handleMessage()` wrapped with span (`squad.coordinator.handleMessage`).

## Why

- Observability is foundational for debugging multi-agent orchestration at runtime.
- Using `@opentelemetry/api` only — no-ops without a registered provider, so zero cost in production unless OTel is configured.
- Trace hierarchy: `coordinator.handleMessage → coordinator.route → coordinator.execute → lifecycle.spawnAgent → agent.spawn`.

## Convention Established

- **Tracer name:** `trace.getTracer('squad-sdk')` — one tracer per package.
- **Span naming:** `squad.{module}.{method}` (e.g., `squad.agent.spawn`).
- **Attributes:** Use descriptive keys like `agent.name`, `routing.tier`, `target.agents`, `spawn.mode`.
- **Error handling:** `span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR })` + `span.recordException(err)` in catch blocks. Always `span.end()` in `finally`.
- **Import only from `@opentelemetry/api`** — never from SDK packages directly.


# Decision: OTel Foundation — NodeSDK over individual providers

**Author:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issues:** #255, #256
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Issues #255 and #256 require OTel provider initialization and a bridge from the existing TelemetryCollector to OTel spans. The OpenTelemetry JS ecosystem has multiple packages (`sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-trace-node`, `sdk-metrics`, `resources`, `exporter-*`) that frequently ship with incompatible transitive versions, causing TypeScript type errors even when runtime behavior is correct.

## Decision

Use `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`'s `NodeSDK` class as the single provider manager, and import `Resource` and `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` from its re-exports (`resources`, `metrics` sub-modules) rather than installing them as direct dependencies.

Direct deps added to `packages/squad-sdk`:
- `@opentelemetry/api`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http`
- `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`

NOT added (bundled via `sdk-node`):
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics`
- `@opentelemetry/resources`

## Consequences

- Single `_sdk.shutdown()` handles both tracing and metrics cleanup.
- No version skew between trace and metric providers.
- `getTracer()` / `getMeter()` return no-op instances when OTel is not initialized — zero overhead in the default case.
- The bridge (`otel-bridge.ts`) is additive — it produces a `TelemetryTransport` that can be registered alongside any existing transport.

## Files Changed

- `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel.ts` — Provider initialization module
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel-bridge.ts` — TelemetryCollector → OTel span bridge
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts` — Barrel exports for both modules
- `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` — Dependencies + subpath exports



### Decision: StreamingPipeline.markMessageStart() as explicit latency tracking entry point

**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issues:** #259, #264

**What:** Latency metrics (TTFT, response duration, tokens/sec) in StreamingPipeline require an explicit `markMessageStart(sessionId)` call before sending a message. This opts callers into latency tracking rather than making it automatic.

**Why:** The pipeline doesn't own the send call — it only sees events after they arrive. Without a start timestamp, TTFT and duration are meaningless. Making it explicit avoids hidden coupling between the pipeline and SquadClient.sendMessage(), and means callers who don't need latency metrics (e.g. tests, offline replay) pay zero overhead.

**Pattern:** Call `pipeline.markMessageStart(sessionId)` → send message → pipeline records TTFT on first `message_delta` with `index === 0`, records duration + tokens/sec when `usage` event arrives. Tracking state auto-cleans after usage event or `clear()`.

**Also:** SquadClient now exposes `sendMessage(session, options)` with `squad.session.message` + child `squad.session.stream` OTel spans, and `closeSession(sessionId)` as a traced alias for `deleteSession`.


### 2026-02-22: Tool trace enhancements + agent metric wiring conventions

**By:** Fenster
**What:** Established patterns for OTel tool span attributes and agent metric wiring:

1. **`sanitizeArgs()`** strips fields matching `/token|secret|password|key|auth/i` before recording as span attributes. Truncates to 1024 chars. Exported from `tools/index.ts` for reuse.
2. **`defineTool` accepts optional `agentName`** in config — recorded as `agent.name` span attribute when present. Does not change the handler signature.
3. **`result.length`** attribute added to `squad.tool.result` events — measures `textResultForLlm` length.
4. **Agent metrics** (`recordAgentSpawn/Duration/Error/Destroy`) wired into both `AgentSessionManager` (index.ts) and `AgentLifecycleManager` (lifecycle.ts). Duration computed from `createdAt` in destroy path.
5. **Parent span propagation** deferred (TODO comment in `defineTool`) — will wire when agent.work span lifecycle is complete.

**Why:** Consistent instrumentation patterns prevent divergence between tool and agent telemetry. The sanitization approach is deliberately simple (field-name matching, not value inspection) to keep it fast and predictable. Agent metrics are wired at both abstraction levels (SessionManager + LifecycleManager) because they can be used independently.

**References:** Issues #260, #262


# Decision: OTel Metric Wiring Pattern (#261, #263)

**Author:** Edie  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Context

Issues #261 and #263 required wiring pre-existing metric functions from `otel-metrics.ts` into the runtime (`StreamingPipeline`) and adapter (`SquadClient`).

## Decision

- **Token usage metrics** (`recordTokenUsage`) are recorded in `StreamingPipeline.processEvent()` AFTER dispatching to user-registered handlers. This ensures user handlers see the event before OTel instrumentation, and handler failures don't block metric recording.
- **Session pool metrics** are recorded at the innermost success/error boundary in `SquadClient`:
  - `recordSessionCreated()` after successful `client.createSession()` return
  - `recordSessionClosed()` after successful `client.deleteSession()` return
  - `recordSessionError()` at the top of inner catch blocks — recorded for EVERY failed attempt, including ones that trigger reconnection. This is intentional: a reconnect-eligible failure is still an error worth counting.
- No new exports needed — barrel and subpath exports were already wired in the Phase 1 otel-metrics scaffold.

## Rationale

Metric calls are no-ops when OTel is not configured (the meter returns no-op instruments), so this adds zero overhead for users without OTel. Recording errors before reconnect checks gives accurate failure counts without double-counting successes (the recursive retry gets its own `recordSessionCreated()` on success).


# Decision: OTel metrics test pattern — spy meter mock

**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented

## What
OTel metrics tests use a spy-meter pattern: mock `getMeter()` to return a fake meter where every `createCounter`/`createHistogram`/`createUpDownCounter`/`createGauge` returns a spy instrument with `.add()` and `.record()` mocks. This allows verifying exact metric names, values, and attributes without a real OTel SDK or collector.

## Why
- The otel-metrics module is a thin instrumentation layer — tests need to verify *what* gets recorded, not *how* OTel processes it.
- Spy meter pattern avoids needing `InMemoryMetricExporter` (which has complex async flush semantics) and keeps tests synchronous and fast.
- Pattern is consistent with existing otel-bridge tests (spy spans via InMemorySpanExporter) but adapted for the metrics API surface.

## Applies to
- `test/otel-metrics.test.ts` (34 tests)
- `test/otel-metric-wiring.test.ts` (5 tests)
- Future OTel metric tests should follow this same pattern.
